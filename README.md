**#1. Project Overview**

***Project Name: ProductManagement***

##Purpose:
The ProductManagement system helps you efficiently track and manage various products stored in a warehouse. It provides a simple interface to maintain product information and monitor stock levels.

##Key Features:

Keep track of products in the warehouse.

Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

Option to mark products as publicly visible or private.

**#2. Objectives**

Provide a user-friendly system to manage product inventory.

Allow users to securely store their credentials.

Enable real-time tracking and updates of product quantities.

Support visibility control for products (public/private).

**#3. Functional Requirements**

User Authentication: Users can register and log in using secure credentials.

Product Management (CRUD):

**Create:** Add new products with quantity, type, and visibility.

**Read:** View products owned by the user.

**Update:** Modify product details such as quantity or type.

**Delete:** Remove products from the system.

**Public Visibility:** Users can choose to display products publicly.

**#4. Database Architecture**

The system uses a relational database with two primary tables:

##4.1 Users Table

Stores user authentication details.

Column Name	Type	Description
username	VARCHAR	Unique username for login
password	VARCHAR	Hashed password for security


##4.2 Products Table

Stores product details associated with each user.

Column Name	Type	Description
username	VARCHAR	The user who owns the product
product	VARCHAR	Name of the product
quantity	INT	Quantity of the product
type	VARCHAR	Type or category of the product
display_publicly	BOOLEAN	Whether the product is visible publicly (Yes/No)
timestamp	TIMESTAMP	Default timestamp of product creation

**#5. System Architecture**

##Overview:

The application uses a client-server architecture.

Users interact with a frontend interface (web or desktop) to perform CRUD operations.

The backend handles authentication, authorization, and database operations.

##Data Flow:

User logs in â†’ backend validates credentials against the Users table.

Authenticated users perform CRUD operations on Products table.

System updates product records and timestamps automatically.

Public products are available for viewing depending on the display_publicly flag.
